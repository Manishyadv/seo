### Search engines are answers machines 

When a person looks for something online, it requires the search engines to scour their corpus of billions of documents and do two things:-

1. First, return only those results that are relevant or useful to the searcher's query, and 

2.  Rank those results in order of perceived usefulness.

It is both "relevance' and  "importance" that the process of SEO is meant to influence.



### Relevance

To a search engine, relevance means more than simply finding a page with the right words

 In the early days of the web, search engines aren't going much further than this simplistic step, and their result suffered as a fallout.

Thus, through evolution, smart engineers devised better ways to find valuable results that searchers would appreciate and enjoy. Today, 100s of factors influences relevance.



### How does search engine figure importance?

Currently, the major engines typically interpret importance as popularity-the more popular a site, page or document, the more valuable the information contained therein must be.

This assumption has proven fairly successful in practice, as the engines have continued to increase user's satisfaction by using metrics that interpret popularity.

Popularity and relevance aren't determined manually, Instead, the engines craft careful, mathematical equations- algorithms, to sort the wheat from the chaff and then rank the wheat in order of tastiness.

These algorithms are often comprised of hundreds of components. In the "search marketing" field, we often refer to them as "ranking factors".
