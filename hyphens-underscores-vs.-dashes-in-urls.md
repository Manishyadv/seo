The recurring question in SEO URLs is whether to use a hyphen, or dash, \(these-are-hyphens\) or an underscore \(these\_are\_underscores\) to separate your words. Does Google recognize both of them as word separators?

The short answer is that **you should use a hyphen for your SEO URLs**. Google treats a hyphen as a word separator, but does _not_ treat an underscore that way. Google treats and underscore as a word joiner â€” so red\_sneakers is the same as redsneakers to Google. This has been confirmed directly by Google themselves, including the fact that using dashes over underscores will have a \(minor\) ranking benefit.

Again, SEO URLs should use hyphens to separate words. Do not use underscores, do not try to use spaces, and do not smash all the words together into one big word. As of 2012, dashes are still the best way to optimize your SEO URLs.
