# HTTPS \(SSL\)

Security is a top priority for Google. Google invest a lot in making sure that our services use industry-leading security, like [strong HTTPS encryption by default](http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2011/11/protecting-data-for-long-term-with.html?utm_source=wmx_blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tls_en_post). That means that people using Search, Gmail and Google Drive, for example, automatically have a secure connection to Google.

Beyond Google's own stuff, Google is also working to make the Internet safer more broadly. A big part of that is making sure that websites people access from Google are secure. For instance, Google have created resources to help webmasters [prevent and fix security breaches](https://www.google.com/webmasters/hacked/?utm_source=wmx_blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tls_en_post) on their sites.

Google want to go even further. At [Google I/O](https://www.google.com/events/io?utm_source=wmx_blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tls_en_post) a few months ago, they called for “[HTTPS everywhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBhZ6S0PFCY&utm_source=wmx_blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tls_en_post)” on the web.

Google also seen more and more webmasters adopting [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure) \(also known as HTTP over [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security), or Transport Layer Security\), on their website, which is encouraging.

For these reasons, over the past few months Google been running tests taking into account whether sites use secure, encrypted connections as a signal in our search ranking algorithms. Google have seen positive results, so they starting to use HTTPS as a ranking signal. For now it's only a very lightweight signal — affecting fewer than 1% of global queries, and carrying less weight than other signals such as [high-quality content](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6001093?utm_source=wmx_blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tls_en_post)— while they give webmasters time to switch to HTTPS. But over time, they may decide to strengthen it, because we’d like to encourage all website owners to switch from HTTP to HTTPS to keep everyone safe on the web.
