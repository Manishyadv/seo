### What is page rank?



Page rank is a numeric value that represents how important a page is on the web



Google figures that when one page links to another page. The more cotes that are cast for a page, the more important the page must be.

Google calculates a page's importance from the vote cast for it. How important each vote is taken into account when a page's PageRank is calculated.



Page rank is Google's way of deciding a page's importance. It's matters because it is one of the factors that determine a page's ranking in the search result. It's isn't the only factor that Google uses to rank the page, but it is an important one.
