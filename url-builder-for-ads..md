# URL builder for Ads.

### Use this tool to add custom campaign parameters to your URLs

You can add parameters \(such as `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, and `utm_campaign`\) to a URL to capture reporting data about the referring campaign. For example, the following link would allow you to identify the traffic to example.com that came from a particular email newsletter, as part of a particular campaign:

`https://example.com?utm_source=news4&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=spring-summer`

You can create your URLs by hand or you can use a URL generator. There are three generators. Be sure to use the correct URL generator because the URLs to websites, the Google Play Store, and the Apple App Store are each a little different from each other.

### Use Campaign URL Builder- This tool allows you to easily add campaign parameters to URLs so you can track [Custom Campaigns](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033863) in Google Analytics.
